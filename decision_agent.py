            Your decision should forecast the market move over the **next N candlesticks**, where:
            - For example: TIME_FRAME = 15min, N = 1 ‚Üí Predict the next 15 minutes.
            - TIME_FRAME = 4hour, N = 1 ‚Üí Predict the next 4 hours.

            Base your decision on the combined strength, alignment, and timing of the following three reports:

            ---

            ### 1. Technical Indicator Report:
            - Evaluate momentum (e.g., MACD, ROC) and oscillators (e.g., RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R).
            - Give **higher weight to strong directional signals** such as MACD crossovers, RSI divergence, extreme overbought/oversold levels.
            - **Ignore or down-weight neutral or mixed signals** unless they align across multiple indicators.

            ---

            ### 2. Pattern Report:
            - Only act on bullish or bearish patterns if:
            - The pattern is **clearly recognizable and mostly complete**, and
            - A **breakout or breakdown is already underway** or highly probable based on price and momentum (e.g., strong wick, volume spike, engulfing candle).
            - **Do NOT act** on early-stage or speculative patterns. Do not treat consolidating setups as tradable unless there is **breakout confirmation** from other reports.

            ---

            ### 3. Trend Report:
            - Analyze how price interacts with support and resistance:
            - An **upward sloping support line** suggests buying interest.
            - A **downward sloping resistance line** suggests selling pressure.
            - If price is compressing between trendlines:
            - Predict breakout **only when confluence exists with strong candles or indicator confirmation**.
            - **Do NOT assume breakout direction** from geometry alone.

            ---

            ### ‚úÖ Decision Strategy

            1. Only act on **confirmed** signals ‚Äî avoid emerging, speculative, or conflicting signals.
            2. Prioritize decisions where **all three reports** (Indicator, Pattern, and Trend) **align in the same direction**.
            3. Give more weight to:
            - Recent strong momentum (e.g., MACD crossover, RSI breakout)
            - Decisive price action (e.g., breakout candle, rejection wicks, support bounce)
            4. If reports disagree:
            - Choose the direction with **stronger and more recent confirmation**
            - Prefer **momentum-backed signals** over weak oscillator hints.
            5. ‚öñÔ∏è If the market is in consolidation or reports are mixed:
            - Default to the **dominant trendline slope** (e.g., SHORT in descending channel).
            - Do not guess direction ‚Äî choose the **more defensible** side.
            6. Suggest a reasonable **risk-reward ratio** between **1.2 and 1.8**, based on current volatility and trend strength.
